# This file is a sample input.yml, input file for esp_generator.py
# 'input.yml' should be included in 'input' directory with 'molecules' directory to run esp_generator.

# In molecules, the number of molecules and the number of conformers for each molecule are assigned. 
# For example, if the user wants to generate espf data for 2 different molecules with 5 conformers each, 
# molecules is like below. (Each coordinate file should be either PDB or Mol2 file format and should be 
# located in molecules/mol(i)/mol(j)/ ((i), (j) is integer) with its filename, mol(i)_mol(j).pdb(or .mol2)  
# molecules : 
#     mol1 : 5
#     mol2 : 5
molecules:
    mol1 : 1
# In charges, the user should provide charge of each molecule. If not, it consider all molecules as neutral.
# if mol1 is neutral and mol2 has -1 charge,  
# charges :
#     mol1 :  0
#     mol2 : -1
charges :
    mol1 : 0

# But for now,  'None' option is not implemented yet, please consider use open-source 'rdkit' instead'
